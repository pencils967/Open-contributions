#Everything in know in **MACHINE LEARNING** 

*Linear Regression 
*Logistic Regression 
*Random Forest 
*Decision Trees
*SVM (Support Vector Machines)
*KNN (K-nearest neighbours)
* Collaborative Filtering
*K-means clustering
*Evalutation Metrics (precision, F1, AOC score)
I am still learning so much more

# Here are a few things I know in **NLP**
*Count Vectorization
*TFID vectroization 
Focusing on Learning the two basic ones for now:
*Named Entity Recognition
*Sentiment Analysis

My limited knowledge in **DEEP LEARNING** (So rigorous and so fascinating to me)
*Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

*Image processing using MATLAB and FIJI (I'm just throwing this out there)
